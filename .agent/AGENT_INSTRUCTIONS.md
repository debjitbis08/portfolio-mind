# Agent Instructions

This file contains instructions for AI coding agents working on this project.

## Project Context Files

Always check `.agent/projects/` for active project status before starting work:

1. **Read first**: Check for existing project files in `.agent/projects/`
2. **Continue work**: If a project file exists for your task, read it to understand current status and continue from where it left off
3. **Document your work**: Always update or create project files to track progress

## Documentation Requirements

When working on any significant feature or enhancement:

1. **Create/update a project file** in `.agent/projects/` with:

   - Current status and goals
   - What has been completed
   - What remains to be done
   - Key decisions made and rationale

2. **Update on completion**: Mark tasks as done and note any follow-up items

3. **Cross-reference**: Link to relevant code files and documentation

## File Naming Convention

Project files should be named descriptively:

- `tool-enhancements.md` - For tool improvement work
- `feature-xyz.md` - For new features
- `bugfix-issue-123.md` - For bug fixes

## Why This Matters

- Enables seamless handoff between sessions
- Prevents duplicate work
- Maintains project context across conversations
- Creates an audit trail of decisions
